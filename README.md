Miner's Horizon is a modern mining dimension mod built for Fabric. It has terrain specifically designed for mining & quarrying, which avoiding the generic super flat design of previous mining dimensions. The default floor is composed of a mixture of stone, which is accented by peaks of grass to add a bit of color to your landscape.

As you progress deeper into the Miner's Horizon, the raw underground materials you find will be more compressed. This leads to them being more difficult to break, but much more plentiful in numbers.

To create a portal to the Miner's Horizon, assemble a grid of Chiseled Stone Bricks, and then click the bottom row with the tool any miner should have on-hand. After this, stand inside the portal, and teleport through by shifting.
